# Local-Problem-Scoping-Streamlit-App
The first prototype of PoliPad's local problem scoping tool. Currently, we are only using article headlines for the data and are still working to make it more accurate and data-inclusive. We are also only using STATE locations at the moment as the news-scraping APIs are unable to pick up enough data when it comes to cities.
